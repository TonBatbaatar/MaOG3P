# MaOG3P: Many-Objective Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming for Program Synthesis

This repository contains **MaOG3P**, a research tool developed to support the experiments presented in the publication:  
**["Enhancing Program Synthesis with Large Language Models Using Many-Objective Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming"](https://doi.org/10.3390/a17070287)**.


MaOG3P is built as an **extension of HeuristicLab**, implementing a customised many-objective genetic programming algorithm designed specifically for grammar-obeying program synthesis. It provides the components necessary to reproduce the results in the paper, including novel multi-objective optimisation algorithms and problem definitions.

## üìñ Overview

MaOG3P enables evolving candidate programs using **many-objective optimisation** techniques that go beyond traditional single-objective approaches. It introduces objectives such as:

- **Error rate** (fitness of the candidate program)
- **Code similarity** (to guide evolution toward more interpretable or desirable structures)

## üß† Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Customised Many-Objective Genetic Programming Algorithm**  
  Tailored for evolving solutions based on multiple objectives, like traditional error-rated evaluation and structural similarity.

- ‚úÖ **Grammar-Guided Program Synthesis Support**  
  Leverages grammar-based rules to evolve syntactically valid programs only.

- ‚úÖ **LLM Integration for Program Seeding**  
  Supports seeding the initial population using LLM-generated code to bootstrap the search.

- ‚úÖ **Pluggable Problem Definitions**  
  Includes multi-objective problem setups specifically designed for the synthesis experiments in the publication.

- ‚úÖ **HeuristicLab Extension**  
  Fully integrates with HeuristicLab for GUI-based experimentation and reuse of existing operators.
